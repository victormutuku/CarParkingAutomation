So the token given at the gate will be used as a tracking device so as to know which parking spot that the car owner has parked their car.

So I need a table to keep track of the tokens. it should have the token ID, the number plate of the car with the token and the parking spot.

<?php
    session_start();
    if(!(isset($_SESSION['user_email']) && $_SESSION['user_email']!="")){
        header("location:login.php");
    }
    // header("location: register.php")
?>

git commit -m "message"
git push origin _branch_Name_
